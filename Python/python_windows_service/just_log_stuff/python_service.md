# Python Service

    How to install python as a Windows Service
    Refer to this documentation for how to setup the service itself:
        https://github.com/jaschlak/MyGuides/tree/master/Python/python_windows_service/simple_example
        
    This program works the same except an entire python project is imported.
    This example only logs to C:\Logs/python_service.log every 5 seconds for visibility into service work
