# Python Strategy Reminders

    A few things to remember when programming in Python
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
    
## PEP8 Basic Syntax

Class names
  * CapWords style
  
Functions
  * lowercase_with_underscores
  
Variable names
  * lowercase_with_underscores
  
Constants
  * CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
  
Clashing Variables with python keywords (I.E. 'for', 'open')
  * trailingunderscore_

notes: 
  * use whitespace between operators (this = that + other)
  * don't include whitespace on the inside of brackets
  * keep lines less than 80 characers
  * avoid "from module import *" commands
  * only perform one statement per line
  * for more advice type "import this" into the command line
